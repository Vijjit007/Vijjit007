    <h2>C Language</h2>
    <h3>Year 1972</h3>
<p> C is a general-purpose programming language developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
It is known for its efficiency, low-level control, and direct memory manipulation capabilities.
C has influenced the development of many other languages and is widely used in systems programming 
and embedded systems.</p><br>

    <h2>Python</h2>
    <h3>Year 1991</h3>
<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by Guido van Rossum.It emphasizes code readability
and simplicity, making it a popular choice for beginners. Python's extensive standard library and vast ecosystem of 
third-party packages make it suitable for various applications, including web development, data analysis, and artificial intelligence.

    <h2>Java</h2>
    <h3>Year 1995</h3>
<p>Java is a widely used, general-purpose programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle).
It is designed to be platform-independent, allowing developers to write code once and run it on any Java-supported platform. Java is known for its "write once, run anywhere" mantra and is commonly used for building enterprise-level applications, Android apps, and large-scale systems.</p>
<br>

<h2>JavaScript</h2>
<h3>Year 1995</h3>
<p>avaScript is a dynamic, high-level programming language primarily used for web development. It was created by Brendan 
Eich at Netscape and is now supported by all modern web browsers. JavaScript enables interactive web elements, dynamic content updates, and client-side scripting. It is also used for server-side development (Node.js) and building desktop or mobile applications (using frameworks like React or Angular).</p>
<br>

<h2>C++</h2>
<h3>Year 1983</h3>
<p>C++ is an extension of the C programming language, adding support for object-oriented programming (OOP) and other features. 
It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an enhancement to C. C++ combines low-level control with high-level abstractions and is widely used in areas such as game development, system programming, and performance-critical applications.</p>
<br>

<h2>Ruby</h2>
<h3>Year 1995</h3>
<p>Ruby is a dynamic, reflective programming language designed for simplicity and productivity.
It was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto and has a focus on human-friendly syntax and developer happiness. Ruby is often associated with the Ruby on Rails web development framework, but it is also used for scripting, prototyping, and building various applications.</p>
